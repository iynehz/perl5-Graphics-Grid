=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graphics::Grid::Functions qw(:all);

    grid_driver( width => 900, height => 300, format => 'svg' );
    grid_rect();    # draw white background

    for my $setting (
        { color => 'red',   x => 1 / 6 },
        { color => 'green', x => 0.5 },
        { color => 'blue',  x => 5 / 6 }
      )
    {
        push_viewport(
            viewport( x => $setting->{x}, y => 0.5, width => 0.2, height => 0.6 ) );
        grid_rect( gp => { fill => $setting->{color}, lty => 'blank' } );
        grid_text( label => $setting->{color}, y => -0.1 );

        pop_viewport();

    grid_write("foo.svg");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the function interface for L<Graphics::Grid>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 unit(%params)

It's equivalent to C<Graphics::Grid::Unit-E<gt>new>.

=head2 viewport(%params)

It's equivalent to C<Graphics::Grid::Viewport-E<gt>new>.

=head2 gpar(%params)

It's equivalent to C<Graphics::Grid::GPar-E<gt>new>.

=head2 push_viewport($viewport)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<push_viewport> method.

=head2 pop_viewport($n=1)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<pop_viewport> method.

=head2 up_viewport($n=1)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<up_viewport> method.

=head2 down_viewport($from_tree_node, $name)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<down_viewport> method.

=head2 seek_viewport($name)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<seek_viewport> method.

=head2 ${grob_type}_grob(%params)

This creates a grob object.

C<$grob_type> can be one of following,

=include grob_types@Graphics::Grid

=head2 grid_${grob_type}(%params)

This creates a grob, and draws it. This is equivalent to Graphics::Grid's
${grob_type}(...) method.

See above for possible C<$grob_type>.

=head2 gtree(%params)

It's equivalent to C<Graphics::Grid::GTree-E<gt>new>.

=head2 grid_draw($grob)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<draw> method.

=head2 grid_driver(:$driver='Cairo', %rest)

Set the device driver. If you don't run this function, the default driver
will be effective.

If C<$driver> consumes Graphics::Grid::Driver, C<$driver> is assigned to
the grid singleton, and C<%rest> is ignored.

    grid_driver(driver => Graphics::Grid::Driver::Cairo->new(...));

If C<$driver> is a string, a C<Graphics::Grid::Driver::$driver> object is
created with C<%rest> as construction parameters, and is assigned to the
grid singleton.

    grid_driver(driver => 'Cairo', width => 800, height => 600);

You may run it at the the beginning of you code. At present changing driver
settings at the middle is not guarenteed to work.

This function returns current width and height.

    my $driver = grid_device();

=head2 grid_write($filename)

It's equivalent to Graphics::Grid's C<write> method.
